The important findings from Assignment 5.1 are - 

1. There are several null or missing items for cars, bars, coffee houses, carry away, restaurants less than 20, and restaurants 20to50. We have a couple of options 1) Drop the missing row from the dataset and 2) replace its value = 0. The problem with dropping missing rows, we might lose valuable insights about the passengers.  So, I chose to replace the missing value with a 0 value. 
2. The proportion of total observation that chose to accept the coupon is about 56 %
3. Of all the coupon categories, Coffee house coupons are the highest (about 4k), followed by restaurant coupons under 20 dollars. 
4. The temperature distribution indicates that data is skewed to high temperatures between 80C and 90C. 
4. Using the value count method on the new data frame, the proportion of bar coupons that the drivers accept is estimated to be 41 %.
5. The bar plot indicates the acceptance of the drivers who went to bar 4 or more is higher than those who go to bar 3 or fewer times. 
6. The acceptance rate for the drivers who visit the bar over 25 is 2x higher than those who do not accept the coupon. If we look at all the age groups, we notice a higher trend in drivers who visit the bar more than once. However, within the group of drivers over 25 yrs of age to all others, we don't see a noticeable difference because of the large standard deviation in the data.  
7. The acceptance rate who go to the bar more than once and had no kids and no occupation other than farming, fishing, and forestry is higher than other drivers who go to the bar less than once, have kinds and belong to farming, fishing, and forestry.
8. The acceptance rate for drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 yrs is 82 %. In comparison, the acceptance rate for drivers who go to the bar less than once and are over 30 yrs is 32.7 %
9. The drivers who accept the bar coupons once have visited the bar more than once, are under the age of 30 yrs, have no kids, and don't belong to an occupation involving farming, fishing, and forestry.
